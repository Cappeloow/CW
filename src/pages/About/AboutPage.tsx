          I am a newly graduated full-stack developer with a passion for building meaningful applications and further developing my skills. During my two years as a student, I have deepened my knowledge in both front-end and back-end technologies, and I've had the opportunity to work on everything from building responsive web applications to designing efficient databases.
        </p>

         On my free time I dedicate myself to projects that I am passionate about. I write, sing, and produce music, developing physical products, baking napolitan pizza.

          During the pandemic, I bought a bicycle to undertake a 2200 km journey from Brom√∂lla to Kiruna, where I lived in a tent for 17 days and finished by climbing Kebnekaise. This adventure has been significant for me in my work life as well, as I learned the importance of breaking down goals into milestones and celebrating victories along the way.
